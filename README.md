# Find_Erors
A multithreaded C program for efficiently detecting errors in a large log file.
A C program that processes large log files to identify and count error codes. I built this entirely on my own as part of an independent learning process â€” exploring how to read large files efficiently, apply multithreading in C, and implement practical algorithmic logic. This was also my first hands-on implementation of threads, file parsing, and hash-based structures in a real-world scenario.
